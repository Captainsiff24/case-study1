### is JPM Coin the new gold standard?
Anyone caught trading bitcoin at JP Morgan will be fired and JP Morgan has came out and said this to his employees. They are developing a Quorum with their close partner and software vendor Consensys. They are hunting young and hungry developers to join them in creating a leading cryptocurrency platform.
